# usb-print

This python script checks a remote WebDav instance at a specific path and sends files to the local cups daemon to print.
It checks the WebDav server every 15 seconds and sends all found files to cups. Afterwards, it moves them to another folder.

If you deploy it with the Docker image, it comes with [olbat/cupsd](https://github.com/olbat/dockerfiles/tree/master/cupsd) as a print server, too.

Just plug your printer and follow the usage instructions below!h
## Usage

You need to set the following environment variables:

* `USB_PRINT_URL`: The URL of your WebDAV server, e.g. "https://dav.example.com"
* `USB_PRINT_USER`: The user to login with = "printer"
* `USB_PRINT_PASSWORD`: The password for the user
* `USB_PRINT_DIRECTORY`: The directory to use for printing. On Nextcloud, if the user the directory belongs to is `printer` and the directory is `printer/print`, this looks like `/remote.php/dav/files/printer/printer/print/`
* `USB_PRINT_ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY`: Where to archive printed files. See `USB_PRINT_DIRECTORY`.

### Locally

You need to have `libcups2-dev` installed (Debian/Ubuntu, on other OS. the package name might be different).

```sh
# Set up a virtual environment to not pollute your system python
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set the required environment variables
export USB_PRINT_URL=https://nextcloud.example.com
export USB_PRINT_USER=printer
export USB_PRINT_PASSWORD=VerySecurePassword
export USB_PRINT_DIRECTORY=/remote.php/dav/files/printer/printer/print/
export USB_PRINT_ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY=/remote.php/dav/files/printer/printer/print-archive/

# Run the script
python src/print.py
```

### With docker-compose

Configure your docker-compose.yml as follows:

```yaml
# You MUST use 2.4 as 3.x+ do not support device_cgroup_rules
version: '2.4'

services:
  print:
    image: registry.git.mor.re/tools/usb-print:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: print
    volumes:
      # Persist cups configuration - you don’t want to add your printer on each reboot, do you?
      - cups-config:/etc/cups
      # Mount the USB bus so that the printer can be turned off and on again. It will get a new mount point,
      # so just mounting the path where it currently sits won’t work
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb

    # This allows your container to read and write to all devices from all cgroups.
    # It’s to broad, but I couldn’t be bothered to narrow it down for now
    device_cgroup_rules:
      - 'a *:* rwm'
    environment:
      - USB_PRINT_URL=https://nextcloud.example.com
      - USB_PRINT_USER=printer
      - USB_PRINT_PASSWORD=VerySecurePassword
      - USB_PRINT_DIRECTORY=/remote.php/dav/files/printer/printer/print/
      - USB_PRINT_ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY=/remote.php/dav/files/printer/printer/print-archive/

    ports:
      # Set this to e.g. 192.168.1.1:631:631 if you want it accessible to only your internal network
      # Leaving it as is will listen on all IP addresses, so think about restricting it!
      - 631:631

volumes:
  cups-config: {}
```

On the first run, you need to add your printer:

1. Run `docker-compose up -d` and open your browser at http://ip-of-your-host:631.
2. Click „Manage printers“ (user: printer, password: printer) and add your printer
3. `docker-compose restart print` as the python script taking care of downloading files via WebDav will exit if there is no printer.
4. Run a test job or check the logs with `docker-compose logs print`.

## Development environment

You need to have `libcups2-dev` installed on Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libcups2-dev
```

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit
```
